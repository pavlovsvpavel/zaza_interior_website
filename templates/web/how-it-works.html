            LISTEN
After discussing your lifestyle and needs during the complimentary consultation, your Design Consultant will help you assess what's important to you and how to create the best use of your space.

VISUALIZE
Now the fun begins! During the consultation, we'll use a number of tools so you can visualize various options for your new space. Your Design Consultant will also take accurate measurements during the consultation â€“ which is key to a functional, flawless space. Put away your tape measure. We do it all for you!

DESIGN
Your Design Consultant will design your project to fill your needs. Designs will have dimensions shown so you know just what to expect. The cost of your project depends on the materials you choose, the components included in the design, and the size of your installation.

INSTALL
Once you approve your design, we'll tell you how to prepare for your installation and what to expect. Installation will occur with minimal disruption to your home and your life. Once complete, your Design Consultant will follow up to see that you are thrilled with the results. Zazainterior installs most projects in one day and will leave your house as clean as it was when we arrived.
